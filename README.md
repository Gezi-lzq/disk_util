# disk_util
the script retrieves disk utilization information for a given storage path. It uses the iostat command to obtain the utilization directly or calculates it based on the difference in disk read/write counts. The resulting utilization is then displayed.

# what is disk utilization

Disk utilization refers to the degree to which a disk or storage device is being utilized or occupied by data or processes. It measures the amount of time the disk is actively performing read and write operations compared to the total time available.

Disk utilization is often expressed as a percentage, representing the ratio of time the disk is busy with input/output (I/O) operations to the total time. A higher utilization percentage indicates that the disk is more actively used and may be experiencing higher I/O demands. Conversely, a lower utilization percentage suggests that the disk is underutilized and may have spare capacity.
